The Usagi Game Engine

Gonna be awhile till this is done cause game engine be big, im mostly just following along with the chernos extremly lengthy game engine series.

But once i know what im doing id like to pivot to making a better rpg maker, since a lot of my favorite games are top town 2D!!!

Despite this the engine will have 3D capability as well as 2D, basically just for portfolio reasons.
